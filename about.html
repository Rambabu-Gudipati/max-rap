						<h3>MAX-RAP: Maximizing the Recyclability of Asphalt Pavements</h3>
						<p><small>A Joint Indo-German Research Initiative</small></p>
						</div>
					<h4>Objective</h4>
					<p>To transform reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) into a fully reusable, high-performance material by
						developing new scientific frameworks for binder-level recyclability, material compatibility, and
						industrial-scale recovery processes.</p>
					<h4 style="margin-top: 30px;">Key Goals</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Quantify RAP binder recyclability using chemical and rheological characterization (FTIR,
							TLC, DSR).</li>
						<li>Develop alternatives to virgin bitumen and rejuvenators using refinery by-products (e.g.,
							slop oil, heavy fractions).</li>
						<li>Isolate and evaluate RAP components by decoupling binder-level behavior from mix-level
							uncertainty.</li>
						<li>Model viscoelastic behavior under temperature and pressure to design performance-optimized
							RAP blends.</li>
						<li>Create industrial protocols to enable selective recovery and maximize reuse of RAP
							fractions.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Research Highlights</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>- Use of pressure–temperature rheology to assess binder aging and recovery.</li>
						<li>- Development of a Recyclability Index and Compatibility Framework to inform mix design.
						</li>
						<li>- Implementation of a binder isolation technique to characterize intrinsic performance.</li>

					</ul>
					<h4>Expected Impact</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Enable 100% RAP utilization in select highway applications.</li>
						<li>Support climate-neutral road construction practices.</li>
						<li>-Provide an open-source framework for standardizing RAP reuse in India and Germany.</li>

					</ul>
					<h4>Project Consortium</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>India: IIT Madras, PSG Tech, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd.</li>
						<li>Germany: Technische Universität Dresden, Heitkamp Straßen- und Tiefbau GmbH.</li>

					<p>In the context of global climate urgency, the field of sustainable road infrastructures is
						experiencing a notable surge in interest and investment. One of the key focal points is the
						widespread adoption of recycling practices. Techniques such as pavement recycling, which
						involves the reuse of existing road materials, significantly contribute to the reduction of
						construction‐related carbon emissions. By minimizing the need for new raw materials and reducing
						waste disposal, recycling initiatives contribute to the circular economy framework, fostering
						resource efficiency and environmental sustainability.</p>

					<p>Innovations in recycling technologies have enabled the efficient recovery and reintegration of
						materials, paving the way for cost‐effective and environmentally conscious road maintenance
						practices. An initiative in this regard is the MAX‐RAP project aimed at instigating a transition
						towards a decarbonized road infrastructure system through the optimisation of asphalt pavement
						recyclability. By leveraging the collective expertise of researchers and industry partners,
						MAX‐RAP endeavours to develop innovative solutions that optimise the recyclability of asphalt
						pavements.</p>
					<p>A few specific aspects addressed by this project are as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>As the binder ages, due to volatilization and other phenomena, the proportion of the maltene
							fraction reduces in the aged binder. This creates an imbalance in its composition and
							results in a blend that does not deliver the desired performance. Thus, the first step in
							recycling is to decide whether the given RAP binder is amenable for recycling. This study
							attempts to check whether a given RAP is suitable for recycling.</li>
						<li>The RAP obtained from field is considerably stiff due to the aging of the binder and the
							effect of wheel loads. The aged binders, when used in larger proportions or have higher
							extents of aging, necessitate the use of rejuvenators. For larger proportions of RAP, the
							use of such rejuvenators may not be feasible as when added in large proportions, these
							blends are known to exhibit poor aging susceptibilities. Thus, alternatives to rejuvenators
							are being explored.</li>
						<li>There are many challenges in hot mix recycling with a majority of them dealing with
							assessing the characteristics of the RAP binder present in RAP. A few of them include
							quantification of the available binder from RAP and its blending with fresh binder. If the
							RAP binder is separated from the mixture, then it is possible to do a straightforward mix
							design with suitable adjustments to account for the increased stiffness of the RAP binder.
							The possibilities of separation of RAP binder from RAP on a large scale is being explored.
						</li>
						<li>The proportion of constituents is expected to differ based on the extent of recyclability of
							the binders. For binders with a higher degree of aging, rejuvenators may have to be added,
							while the same may not be necessary for binders with a lower extent of aging. The
							proportioning of blend constituents will be carried out accordingly such that the resultant
							binder exhibits target rheological properties with maximum utilisation of RAP. In addition,
							appropriate laboratory testing methods will be used to investigate the performance of the
							recycled blends.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The outcomes of this project are expected to result in a framework for recycling binders based on
						the extent of recyclability of the blends with consideration to maximum utilisation of RAP and
						incorporation of alternatives to commercially available rejuvenators.</p> -->
